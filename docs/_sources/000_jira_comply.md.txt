# Planning for the Prototype Parallel Cluster

- code name uberBrandon
- code name chaosMonkey - terraform creation IaC

# Current Sprint 
- Ending November 3, 2023 
- weekly status

## Analysis Focus

1. Develop LDAP Skills
2. Trade Study on M$ Active Directory vs. Pure LDAP
    - these user management platforms are potential rabbit holes - there be dragons
    - LDAP - likely the MVP
    - M$ ActiveDirectory Enetrprise to be used in Deployment Phase
    - to explore pythin-ldap for mangement of users and passwords - perhaps next sprint
3. Integration - connecting LDAP to parallel cluster from startup yaml file 
    - Goal is to support user, password initiation for cluster access
    - Instead of hard-coded sh keys - we can certainly use this for alpha testers - to be scheduled in a sprint
    - first planned science user test is Tonian's Composite Parallel Slurm Test - depending on when the code is ready
4. Terraform analysis and CICD pipeline for SDLC Deployment Phase - chaosMonkey

--- 
## Planning Focus
1. Writing Project Plan with SDLC Phases
    - strategy is to use this meeting time for internal planning blocks until our project matures or gels
2. Developing the project plan - draft to be published November 3.


### SDLC Phase Summary

    Stage 0: Feasibility and Concept Development
    Stage 1: Project Planning. The first stage of SDLC is all about “What do we want?” ...
    Stage 2: Gathering Requirements & Analysis. ...
    Stage 3: Design and Documentation. ...
    Stage 4: Coding or Implementation. ...
    Stage 5: Testing and Documentation. ...

## User Story

> scientist walks into a website, types a username and password and runs a slurm, sbatch job ported from Tallgrass.

- minimal effort is needed to move from Tallgrass
- alpha test is ARD animations - Butzer
- beta test in ARD composites - Tonian Robinson
