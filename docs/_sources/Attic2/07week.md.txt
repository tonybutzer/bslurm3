## AWS S3 Pricing

There are three major costs associated with S3:

- Storage cost: charged per GB / month. ~ $0.03 / GB / month, charged hourly
- API cost for operation of files: ~$0.005 / 10000 read requests, write requests are 10 times more expensive
- `Data transfer outside of AWS region:` ~$0.02 / GB to different AWS region, ~$0.06 / GB to the internet.

Based on volume and region the actual prices differs a bit, but optimization techniques stay the same. I will use the above prices in following cost estimates.
