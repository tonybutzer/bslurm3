# Agile Terminology


Certainly! Here is a list of common Agile development terms along with their definitions:

1. **User Stories**:
   - **Definition**: User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature or functionality told from the perspective of an end user. They focus on the value a particular feature brings to the user.

2. **Epics**:
   - **Definition**: Epics are large bodies of work that can be broken down into smaller tasks or user stories. They represent a set of related user stories.

3. **Sprints**:
   - **Definition**: Sprints are time-boxed periods (usually 2-4 weeks) during which a set amount of work must be completed. It's a regular, repeatable work cycle in Scrum.

4. **Tasks**:
   - **Definition**: Tasks are the individual pieces of work that need to be completed to fulfill a user story. They are the smallest units of work in Agile.

5. **Backlog**:
   - **Definition**: The backlog is a prioritized list of features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other work items that a team maintains. It's a dynamic document that evolves over time.

6. **Product Owner**:
   - **Definition**: The Product Owner is a role responsible for defining and prioritizing the product backlog. They represent the stakeholders' interests and ensure that the team is working on the most valuable features.

7. **Scrum Master**:

8. **Velocity**:
   - **Definition**: Velocity is a metric used in Agile to measure the amount of work a team can complete in a sprint. It helps in predicting future workloads and planning sprints.

9. **Definition of Done (DoD)**:
   - **Definition**: The Definition of Done is a clear and agreed-upon list of criteria that must be satisfied for a user story or task to be considered complete.

10. **Daily Stand-up (Daily Scrum)**:

12. **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - **Definition**: Criteria that a user story must meet to be considered completed and accepted by the Product Owner.

13. **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
    - **Definition**: The practice of automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository multiple times a day.

14. **Continuous Delivery (CD)**:
    - **Definition**: The practice of automatically deploying code changes to production or staging environments after passing automated tests.

15. **Retrospective**:
    - **Definition**: A meeting held at the end of a sprint where the team reflects on their process and identifies ways to improve in the next sprint.

16. **Increment**:
    - **Definition**: The sum of all the product backlog items completed during a sprint, plus the value of work from previous sprints.

17. **Sprint Review**:
    - **Definition**: A meeting held at the end of a sprint where the team demonstrates the work completed and seeks feedback from stakeholders.

18. **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**:
