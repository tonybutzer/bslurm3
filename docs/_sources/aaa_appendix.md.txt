# Stage A: Appendix


> The situational leadership model presented in the "One Minute Manager" book, co-authored by Kenneth Blanchard and Spencer Johnson. This model categorizes individuals into four different development levels, and the manager adjusts their leadership style based on the employee's skill and willingness to perform. Here's a brief overview:

1. **D1 - Low Competence/High Commitment (Enthusiastic Beginner):** At this level, individuals have low competence in the task at hand, but they are highly committed and eager to learn. In this situation, the manager's role is to provide clear directions and closely supervise the work.

2. **D2 - Some Competence/Variable Commitment (Disillusioned Learner):** Individuals at this level have gained some competence, but their commitment may vary. They might be discouraged or uncertain. The manager's role is to continue providing support and direction while also offering praise and encouragement to boost commitment.

3. **D3 - Moderate to High Competence/Low to Variable Commitment (Capable but Cautious Performer):** At this stage, individuals have developed moderate to high competence, but their commitment may be low or variable. The manager should focus on supporting and facilitating the person's efforts, allowing for more autonomy while still offering guidance and support.

4. **D4 - High Competence/High Commitment (Self-Reliant Achiever):** Individuals at this level are highly skilled and committed. They are capable of working independently. The manager's role is to delegate and empower, giving them the autonomy to take on tasks and make decisions.

> The key idea behind the model is that effective leadership involves adapting your style based on the development level of the person you are managing. This approach recognizes that individuals progress through different stages of development and that a one-size-fits-all leadership style may not be the most effective.
